# pet-info-management
The Pet Management System is a project developed in C programming language. 

The main aim of this project is to store and manage details of different pets such as their name, age, breed, and health information. 

In this project, I used concepts like functions, strings, arrays, and file handling to perform various operations such as adding, viewing, updating, and deleting pet records. 

This project helps to understand how data can be stored and managed efficiently using files in C without using binary language.

Through this project, I learned how to use file handling to store data permanently, how to work with functions and arrays to make the code organized, and how strings are used to handle textual data. 💻

This project helped me to improve my logical thinking, problem-solving, and programming skills.

It was a great opportunity. What I learned in theory to a real-world type of program. 

Ifor giving this project, as it motivated me to explore more about C programming and data management. 🌟
